# Fingerprint_DDPM
Code for Fingerprinting Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models.

My previous device is no longer available, so I reproduced and simplified this project on a new device (one H20 GPU, 96G VRAM).

The code development refers to DDPM inversion. Thanks to them: https://github.com/inbarhub/DDPM_inversion.

The download links for different pretrained models as well as the uniqueness and robustness analysis are provided in eval.sh.
